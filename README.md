## Hi there, I'm Harshal Dupare ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd year undergraduate from the Mathematics Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I love exploring the world of code & algorithms! I'm majorly interested in the field of Complex Networks, Optimization Methods, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Reinforcement Learning occasionally I also work on software development.
